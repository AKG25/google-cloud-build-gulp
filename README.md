Example on how to use gulp with Google Cloud Container Builder.

There are a few ways you might want to use the static files generated by gulp.

## Serve
You might want to serve them from a static server of your own. In this case,
let's package the server and the content in a container (using `Dockerfile`):

```
gcloud container builds submit . --config=cloudbuild.container.yaml
gcloud docker -- run -p 3000:3000 gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/gulp-example:latest
curl localhost:3000
```

## Google Cloud Storage
You might want to store the static files in Google Cloud Storage from where
your application can fetch them.

```
gcloud container builds submit . --config=cloudbuild.gcs.yaml
```

Share the files publicly from the Google Cloud Console, then:

```
curl http://storage.googleapis.com/gulp-example/index.html
```
